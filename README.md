# Kreatures
This application allows the user to place a creature into a virtual environment with other creatures. The user can then observe their creature's activity.

## Background
I created this application in 2017 as I was getting into python for the first time. It was one of the first programs that I was proud of.

## Interakt
This idea is expanded upon in the [Interakt](https://github.com/McCoy-Software-Solutions/Interakt) project.
