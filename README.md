# Kreatures
This game allows you to place a creature into a virtual environment with other creatures and observe its activity.

## Background
I created this application in 2017 as I was getting into python for the first time. It was one of the first programs that I was proud of.

## Main Idea
You're able to create a creature and release it into an environment where it can interact with other creatures.

## Ideas
- World already has creatures
- Every time creature comes into contact with another it has a chance to eat, become friends or have a baby
- The more you do one thing the less you do the others
- It has 4 different areas so that they're not all interacting with the same things
- Every day there's a chance they'll move areas

## Goals
- Show creatures alive at all times
- Make inputted names possible baby names using a txt file

## Interakt
The ideas in this project are generalized and expanded upon in the [Interakt](https://github.com/Stephenson-Software/Interakt) and [Apex](https://github.com/Stephenson-Software/Apex) projects.
