Main Idea -----------------------------------------

You're able to create a creature and release it into an environment where it can interact with other creatures.


Ideas -----------------------------------------
- World already has creatures
- Every time creature comes into contact with another it has a chance to eat, become friends or have a baby
- The more you do one thing the less you do the others
- It has 4 different areas so that they're not all interacting with the same things
- Every day there's a chance they'll move areas

Goals -----------------------------------------
- Get rid of chance to make a baby and put it in make friend instead
- Show creatures alive at all times
